Tests for QCloud

There are at the moment no automation which side to run and the file structures are hard coded, but when they are there 
all tests are green.

Before running one should add their connection information to each test. This is kinda stupid, but will change someday

todo:
 generalization of tests
 making it so that tests create the needed file structure to cloud before running
