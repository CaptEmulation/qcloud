QCloud-API

QCloud-API provides public API to call Windows Azure and Amazon S3. 

Requirements:
 Qt5 (tested with beta1)

Installation:

Linux: (Tested: Debian 2.6.32-45)
 qmake
 make


The user needs account on either amazon or windows azure. The credentials to amazon can be found
in the aws dashboard (https://console.aws.amazon.com/). Azure's credentials can be found from
https://manage.windowsazure.com/. Insert the credentials as cloudconnections params as they 
are presented in the sites. Do not do anything to them. 

Note:

Amazon has a interesting naming contention for the buckets. The bucket names are shared between
all of the users (a single namespace), so the most used are already taken. The rest of the naming
rules are as follows:
 
    Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long
    Bucket name must be a series of one or more labels separated by a period (.), where each label:
    Must start with a lowercase letter or a number
    Must end with a lowercase letter or a number
    Can contain lowercase letters, numbers and dashes
    Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.5.4)


Example usage.
 Getting a file from a certain bucket in the cloud:
    Include the lib in your project. 
    Create a new CloudConnection for the service you want (Azure*, Amazon*)
    Get the list of buckets with QCloudConnection::getCloudDir()
    Get the contents of certain bucket with QCloudConection::getCloudDirContents(QString name)
    Get the file using QCloudConnection::get(QString bucket, QString fileName)

 Putting a file to a certain bucket in the cloud:
    Include the lib
    Create new connection for the service
    if (bucketname not known)
       Get bucket list with getCloudDir()
    create a QFile that contains the file
    Create qcloudfile from the qfile
    call put(qcloudfile, bucket)

 examples/QCloudTransfer/main.cpp is a good indication how to use the api.

TODO:
 -Both services need implementation of the deleteBlob and deleteCloudDir -functions. 

 -As AmazonS3 has the requirement that buckets cannot contain uppercase letters, 
  somekind of check should be placed somewhere. At the moment error is thrown.

 -The content-type-header should be replaced according to the real type of the
  file sent. At the moment it is always text/plain.

 -As using QCloud should be as similar to QNAM as possible, the structure should 
  be changed to use the async methods.
 
 -QCloudTransfer-example supports only AmazonS3 at the moment. There needs to be 
  some change that can change the service provider according the params. Maybe 
  in the auth.txt the first line could be the provider (aws, azure) etc..

 -As a cloudconnection is created check if the credentials are correct
